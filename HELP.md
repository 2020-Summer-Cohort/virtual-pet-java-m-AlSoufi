# Virtual Pet

This application allows the end user to play a game loop where they interact with a virtual pet and respond to its
 needs.

The user is being informed of the pet's needs initially and is prompted to make a selection which will determine which
of the pet's needs are taken care of. As time passes, the pet's needs increase. The user cannot satisfy only or tow of
the pet's needs and ignore the rest of them. The needs that are ignored will go out of control and the pet's situation
will deteriorate based on the stats shown. Stats are diplayed are each user choice.

When the user is done playing the game, they can press 6 to exit the game.
